Work Experience
----------

**2011-Present Research Assistant, Texas A&M University (College Station, TX)**

Conducted research on improvements to particle accelerators with the
Accelerator Research Laboratory.  Responsibilities included designing and
running simulations (COMSOL multiphysics, finite elements, particle-in-cell),
analyzing results and producing summary plots and technical reports, as well as 
mentoring new graduate and undergraduate students.

**2008-2011 IT Administrator, Leonard Paper Company (Baltimore, MD)**

Served as head of IT, responsible for ~100 desktop workstations, ~40 laptops,

with users to resolve computer problems, automated administrative processes and
reporting, and advised company management on long-term IT decisions (e.g.
software upgrades, telephony, hardware purchasing). Created custom version of
the terminal emulation software PuTTY to interface with proprietary inventory
system, replacing equivalent software for a savings of $400/seat and allowing
the entire salesforce to use the system concurrently.

Programming Languages and Skills
----------

**Python:** proficient with the SciPy stack, predominantly numpy and
matplotlib. Exposure to most of the standard libraries. Skilled
in managing a development environment using pip, Anaconda, Vagrant.  

**Shell/awk scripting, GNU utilities:** Experience with Linux/Unix environments,
creation of scripts for process automation and data wrangling, system
configuration and other administrative tasks.

**Javascript:** Familiarity with jQuery, d3.js, three.js in the browser.  Some
