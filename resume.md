:   **PhD, Physics**  
    Texas A&M University (College Station, TX)  
    _Research interests:_ transport of intense charged particle beams through
    magnetic lattices, particle-in-cell simulation, magnetic and mechanical
    design of cost-effective superconducting dipole and quadrupole magnets for
    scientific, industrial, and medical applications.

Work Experience
----------

**Nov 2019-Present(furloughed) Software Engineer, Neurala, Inc.**

Python-centric member of the Applications Engineering team. Responsibilities
include the development of Flask servers to provide customers with REST APIs
for interacting with in-house inference engines, maintenance of Python language
bindings to a large C++ codebase generated with SWIG, and refactoring machine
learning research prototypes (e.g. TensorFlow) to create reliable products.

**2011-Nov 2019 Research Assistant, Texas A&M University (College Station, TX)**

Conducted research on improvements to particle accelerators with the
Accelerator Research Laboratory.  Responsibilities included designing and
running simulations (COMSOL multiphysics, finite elements, particle-in-cell),
analyzing results and producing summary plots and technical reports, as well as 
mentoring new graduate and undergraduate students.

**2008-2011 IT Administrator, Leonard Paper Company (Baltimore, MD)**

Served as head of IT, responsible for ~100 desktop workstations, ~40 laptops,
Oracle and MySQL databases, and AIX, Windows, and Linux servers.  Interacted
with users to resolve computer problems, automated administrative processes and
reporting, and advised company management on long-term IT decisions (e.g.
software upgrades, telephony, hardware purchasing). Created custom version of
the terminal emulation software PuTTY to interface with proprietary inventory
system, replacing equivalent software for a savings of $400/seat and allowing
the entire salesforce to use the system concurrently.

Programming Languages and Skills
----------

**Python:** proficient with the SciPy stack, standard libraries, pytest. Experience
developing and deploying Flask servers on a uWSGI+Nginx stack in both standalone
and containerized Docker contexts. Some experience with SWIG. 

**Shell/awk scripting, GNU utilities:** Experience with Linux/Unix environments,
creation of scripts for process automation and data wrangling, system
configuration and other administrative tasks.

**Javascript:** Familiarity with jQuery, d3.js, three.js in the browser.  Some
experience using Node.js for server-side applications using e.g. Socket.io.

**Other proficiencies:** COMSOL Multiphysics, C++, R, MATLAB, Mathematica, 
Excel (including VBA), HTML/CSS, image editing.
